Usage
-----
Functions are demonstrated bellow, upon failure an exception will be raised,
upon success but no appearance false will be returned, upon appearance an
integer containing the frequency will be returned. 

> api = SFS::API.new
=> #<SFS::API:0x89b51c4>

> ip = api.check_ip("91.186.18.61")
=> 31

> email = api.check_email("g2fsehis5e@mail.ru")
=> 1

> username = api.check_username("MariFoogwoogy")
=> 1

Because of the way the Ruby language works you can simply treat the result
as a true or false comparison.

> if (ip)
>   puts "IP is present!"
> end
IP is present!
